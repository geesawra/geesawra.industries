# Blog Post Analysis: MNT Reform notes

I've reviewed your latest version of the MNT Reform blog post, and I'm pleased to see it's now in excellent shape. You've addressed nearly all the issues identified in previous critiques, resulting in a polished, engaging, and informative piece.

## Strengths
- Well-balanced personal tone that connects with your tech-savvy audience
- Comprehensive coverage of hardware and software aspects
- Effective use of images and informative footnotes
- Clear organization with logical section breaks
- Good balance between enthusiasm and honest critique

## Previously Addressed Issues
- The display issue is now clearly explained with "horizontal bands and color distortion"
- The explanation of SoC in footnotes is helpful for readers unfamiliar with the term
- You've fixed the thermal issues explanation, making clear how it affects usability
- The split spacebar explanation now clarifies its practical benefit of alleviating wobble
- Display specifications now include PPI information for better context

## Remaining Minor Considerations:

### Dash Usage Consistency
You continue to use a mix of double dashes (--) and triple dashes (---) in the text. While triple dashes are used as section breaks, you also use double dashes within sentences like:

"a pretty nice property for a device that you can disassemble and reassemble on your own."

For consistency, consider standardizing on em dashes (â€”) for in-sentence breaks.

### Sentence Structure in Display Hinges Description
The sentence about display hinges has been improved to:

"I love the display hinges MNT chose: they're sturdy and hard enough that they allow you to open the lid with a single finger."

This flows better than the previous version.

### Minor Typo in Split Spacebar Description
There's a minor number agreement issue in:

"Their choice of splitting the space bar into three separate zone alleviates the wobbly spacebar issue."

"Zone" should be "zones" to match the "three separate" modifier.

## Overall Assessment

This blog post effectively communicates your experience with the MNT Reform Classic laptop. The balance between technical details and personal observations makes it highly accessible and engaging for your target audience. Your enthusiasm for the device comes through clearly while you remain honest about its limitations.

Your conclusion nicely captures the appeal of the Reform as a "hacking laptop" rather than a primary computer, highlighting its value for those who appreciate customizable computing experiences. The few remaining issues are minor and don't significantly detract from the overall quality of the piece.

The blog post is ready to publish, providing valuable insights for readers interested in this unique open hardware device.
