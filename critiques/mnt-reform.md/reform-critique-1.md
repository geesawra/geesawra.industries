# Blog Post Analysis: MNT Reform notes

Overall, this is an engaging and informative blog post about your experience with the MNT Reform Classic laptop. Your enthusiasm for the device comes through clearly, and you provide a good balance of technical details and personal experience. However, there are several areas where improvements could enhance clarity, flow, and reader understanding.

## Strengths
- Engaging personal tone that connects well with tech-savvy readers
- Good balance of technical details and user experience
- Effective use of footnotes to provide additional context
- Clear organization with section breaks

## Areas for Improvement:

### Syntax and Spelling

1. **Inconsistent device naming**:
   You introduce "MNT Reform Classic (henceforth referred to as Reform)" but still use "MNT Reform" in several places. For consistency, stick with "Reform" throughout after the initial introduction.

2. **Spelling errors**:
   "obbligations" in the final section should be "obligations".

3. **Punctuation issues**:
   In the sentence "While MNT tests devices before sending them out, I feel this one is so subtle and random they couldn't diagnose this easily," the comma creates a run-on sentence. Consider: "While MNT tests devices before sending them out, I feel this issue is so subtle and random that they couldn't diagnose it easily."

4. **Inconsistent hyphenation**:
   "top-specced" but later "hand-assembled" - choose a consistent style.

### Flow and Clarity

1. **Ambiguous reference**:
   When you write "I think my order came at an unfortunate time: MNT was in the middle of shipping the first iteration of their Pocket Reform, which was powered by the same SoC I picked," it's not immediately clear what "SoC" refers to for readers unfamiliar with the term. Consider introducing this acronym (System on Chip) for clarity.

2. **Unclear technical references**:
   The sentence "One thing I had to find a workaround for was Vulkan: the GPU embedded in the RK3588 SoC needs newer `mesa` packages that implement 1.2 revision of Vulkan to use things like Zed editor" assumes readers know what Vulkan and mesa packages are. Consider adding a brief explanation.

3. **Paragraph coherence**:
   The paragraph about the keyboard switches feels disjointed. It jumps from criticism to praise and back. Consider reorganizing for better flow:

   "Unfortunately the switches aren't really that good in my opinion: they are clearly not lubed, they cling and clang when you mash onto them harder, and overall they sound like one of the first gamer-oriented mechanical keyboards. I'm going to experiment in the future about this, especially around sound dampening and isolation. The flipside is there's basically zero keyboard flex, keycaps and fully configurable RGB lighting are **really good**, and since it's open hardware I could just pop the keyboard out, replace the switches and call it a day."

4. **Incomplete thought**:
   "RK3588 booting is weird in by itself as well" is followed by a footnote but not elaborated in the main text. Consider adding a sentence or two about this weirdness for readers who won't click the footnote.

5. **Double dash usage**:
   You use "——" in "turning the device off through the operating system works as long as it's running the Reform device driver —— turning the device off" where a single em dash or colon would be more appropriate.

### Reader Understanding

1. **Unexplained display issue**:
   You mention "an issue with the display which is due to a bad interface soldering job done at the factory" but never explain what the actual issue is or how it affects usage. This leaves readers curious without resolution.

2. **Technical jargon without context**:
   Terms like "LSP", "RK3588", "EDK2", "UEFI" are used with minimal explanation. While your intended audience is tech-savvy, providing brief context would improve comprehension.

3. **Incomplete comparison**:
   "All in all it runs hotter than most modern laptops, but not hotter than 2016-2021 era Macbooks :^)" - the emoticon suggests an inside joke that might not be clear to all readers. Consider elaborating on the Macbook thermal issues for context.

4. **Vague reference**:
   "Rockchip devices can boot from either SD or eMMC" - you don't clearly explain what eMMC is for readers who might not be familiar with the term.

### Enhancement Examples

1. For the unclear reference to SoC:
   "I think my order came at an unfortunate time: MNT was in the middle of shipping the first iteration of their Pocket Reform, which was powered by the same System on Chip (SoC) I picked, the RK3588, which was also backordered for months."

2. For the display issue:
   "Hardware-wise the laptop is almost flawless, except for an issue with the display which is due to a bad interface soldering job done at the factory[^display]. This causes occasional flickering and color distortion when the screen is adjusted to certain positions, which I'm sure MNT will take care of."

3. For the technical explanation of Vulkan:
   "One thing I had to find a workaround for was Vulkan (the 3D graphics API): the GPU embedded in the RK3588 SoC needs newer `mesa` packages that implement 1.2 revision of Vulkan to use applications like Zed editor[^vulkan]."

4. For the booting explanation:
   "Reform has an NVMe slot that works really well — reaching roughly ~2GB/s, ~800MB/s sequential read/write speeds on a desktop-class drive — but the device **cannot** boot natively from it. This is because Rockchip devices can only boot from either SD card or eMMC (embedded MultiMediaCard) storage."

Overall, your blog post provides valuable insights into an unconventional computing device. With these enhancements to clarity and consistency, it would be even more accessible and informative for your audience.
