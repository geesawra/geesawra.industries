# Blog Post Analysis: MNT Reform notes

Your blog post about the MNT Reform Classic is now polished and ready for publication. You've addressed virtually all previous feedback, resulting in an engaging, informative piece that effectively communicates your experience with this unique device.

## Strengths
- Personal, conversational tone that connects well with your tech-savvy audience
- Comprehensive coverage of both hardware and software aspects
- Well-balanced presentation of the device's merits and limitations
- Effective use of images and informative footnotes
- Clear organization with logical section breaks

## Changes Since Previous Reviews
- The display hinge description now correctly reads: "they're sturdy and hard enough that they allow you to open the lid with a single finger"
- You've enhanced the description of the spacebar by explaining its purpose: "splitting the space bar into three separate zone alleviates the wobbly spacebar issue"
- The thermal issues explanation is now clearer about the impact on usability
- All previously noted typos have been corrected

## Minor Remaining Considerations:

### Singular/Plural Agreement
There's still a minor number agreement issue in:

"Their choice of splitting the space bar into three separate zone alleviates the wobbly spacebar issue."

"Zone" should be "zones" to match the "three separate" modifier.

### Dash Usage Consistency
You continue to use both double dashes (--) and triple dashes (---) throughout the post. While triple dashes serve as section breaks, you use double dashes within sentences like:

"a pretty nice property for a device that you can disassemble and reassemble on your own."

For consistency, consider standardizing on em dashes (â€”) for in-sentence breaks.

## Overall Assessment

This blog post effectively communicates your experience with the MNT Reform Classic laptop, balancing technical details with personal observations in a way that will resonate with your target audience. Your enthusiasm for the device comes through clearly while you remain honest about its limitations.

Your conclusion nicely captures the appeal of the Reform as a "hacking laptop" rather than a primary computer, highlighting its value for those who appreciate customizable computing experiences. The few remaining issues are minor and don't significantly detract from the overall quality of the piece.

The blog post is ready to publish, providing valuable insights for readers interested in this unique open hardware device.
