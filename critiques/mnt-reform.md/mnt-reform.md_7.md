# Blog Post Analysis: MNT Reform notes

I've reviewed your updated blog post about the MNT Reform Classic, and I'm pleased to see that you've addressed most of the issues identified in previous critiques. The post is engaging, informative, and provides a balanced perspective on this unique device.

## Strengths
- Personal, conversational tone that resonates well with a tech-savvy audience
- Comprehensive coverage of both hardware and software aspects
- Effective use of images and informative footnotes
- Clear organization with logical section breaks
- Good balance between enthusiasm and honest critique

## Improvements from Previous Versions
- Display issue is now clearly explained: "horizontal bands and color distortion when adjusting the display"
- Technical terms like SoC have been properly explained in footnotes
- The battery properties section flows better with the added "But!" transition
- Thermal issues are more clearly described in terms of user impact
- Most sentence structure and typo issues have been addressed

## Minor Remaining Considerations:

### Dash Usage Consistency
You continue to use both double dashes (--) and triple dashes (---) throughout the post. For consistency, it would be better to standardize on one style. Triple dashes are used for section breaks, while double dashes appear in sentences like:
   
"a pretty nice property for a device that you can disassemble and reassemble on your own."

### Sentence Structure in Display Description
The sentence "I love the display hinges MNT chose: they're sturdy and hard enough they allow you to open the lid with a single finger" would flow better as:

"I love the display hinges MNT chose: they're sturdy and hard enough that they allow you to open the lid with a single finger."

### Split Spacebar Explanation
You've improved the description to "Their choice of splitting the space bar into three separate zone alleviates the wobbly spacebar issue," which explains the benefit but there's a minor typo: "zone" should be "zones" for proper subject-verb agreement.

## Overall Assessment

This blog post effectively communicates your experience with the MNT Reform Classic laptop. The balance between technical details and personal observations makes it accessible and engaging for your target audience. Your enthusiasm for the device is evident while you remain honest about its limitations.

Your conclusion nicely captures the appeal of the Reform as a "hacking laptop" rather than a primary computer, highlighting its value for those who appreciate customizable computing experiences. The few remaining issues are minor and don't significantly detract from the overall quality of the piece.

The blog post is now well-polished and ready to publish, providing valuable insights for readers interested in this unique open hardware device.
